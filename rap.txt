Made of gods, covered with slabs of wood
Hit with rods, covered with stabs from wounds
Consumed with the sounds I make in my head
I'm dead and empty inside. But hey, I'm good.
What's up?

The way I'm violated keeps me pumped and motivated
It's not complicated, beat me down and never say shit
Being apologetic never undid the deeds so man don't say shit
My feeling  imprisoned in my mind and mouth like it's braces
Okay then
